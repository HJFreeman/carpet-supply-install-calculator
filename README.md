# carpet-supply-install-calculator
a calculator to calculate the cost of supplying carpet, with installation and any other associated costs.
I am looking for help with this so please feel free to contribute, I am new to programming so eager to learn, 
I would like to add a function so the console asks for user input such as "please enter length and width of carpet" etc
this project has no interface as of yet as I have not yet learned how to do this.
